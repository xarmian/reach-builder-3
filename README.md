# Reach Builder Challenge Week 3 - Level 3

This project was created based on the Reach Builder Week 3 Challenge.
The specifications of the challenge are:

- Build out a front end GUI
- Use the framework of your choice
- It will contain as many files as you need to complete the task
- Use a testnet token
- Create your own testnet token and import the asset ID number from the Deployer UI
- Allow users to submit their wallets to the application
- The first 5 users to submit their wallets are whitelisted
- Users after 5 receive an error message stating the list is full
- The whitelisted addresses receive tokens

The contract allows the deployer to specify a number of addresses
permitted to submit their wallets for whitelisting
and the number of tokens to be distributed per address
